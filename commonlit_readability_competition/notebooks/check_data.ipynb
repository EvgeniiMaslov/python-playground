       "Counter({'when the young people returned to the ballroom , it presented a decidedly changed appearance . instead of an interior scene , it was a winter landscape . the floor was covered with snow-white canvas , not laid on smoothly , but rumpled over bumps and hillocks , like a real snow field . the numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room , were powdered with flour and strewn with tufts of cotton , like snow . also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them , and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches . at each end of the room , on the wall , hung a beautiful bear-skin rug . these rugs were for prizes , one for the girls and one for the boys . and this was the game . the girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other , and one end was called the north pole , and the other the south pole . each player was given a small flag which they were to plant on reaching the pole . this would have been an easy matter , but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes .': 1,\n",

'' `` oh , mother ! '' dolly cried , overwhelmed with sudden delight . `` really ? oh , i am so glad ! are you sure you 're willing ? '' `` i 've persuaded myself to be willing , against my will , '' returned mrs. fayre , whimsically . `` i confess i just hate to have you go , but i ca n't bear to deprive you of the pleasure trip . and , as you say , it would also keep dotty at home , and so , altogether , i think i shall have to give in . '' `` oh , you angel mother ! you blessed lady ! how good you are ! '' and dolly flew around the table and gave her mother a hug that nearly suffocated her .\": 1,\n",

'' `` well , i like that ! '' cried patty ; `` suppose you bear half the blame , roger . you see , mr. blaney , he is so absorbed in his own love game , he ca n't play with his old-time skill .

       "         \"hal and chester found ample time to take an inventory of the general 's car . it was a huge machine , and besides being fitted up luxuriously was also furnished as an office , that the general might still be at work while he hurried from one part of the field to another when events demanded his immediate presence . even now , with treachery threatening , and whirling along at a terrific speed , general joffre , probably because of habit , fell to work sorting papers , studying maps and other drawings . for almost two hours the car whirled along at top speed , and at length pulled up in the rear of an immense body of troops , who , even to hal and chester , could be seen preparing for an advance . general joffre was out of the car before it came to a full stop , and hal and chester were at his heels . an orderly approached . `` my respects to general tromp , and tell him i desire his presence immediately , '' ordered general joffre .\": 1,\n",

       "         \"on the twenty-second of february , 1916 , an automobile sped northward along the french battle line that for almost two years had held back the armies of the german emperor , strive as they would to win their way farther into the heart of france . for months the opposing forces had battled to a draw from the north sea to the boundary of switzerland , until now , as the day waned—it was almost six o'clock—the hands of time drew closer and closer to the hour that was to mark the opening of the most bitter and destructive battle of the war , up to this time . it was the eve of the battle of verdun . the occupants of the automobile as it sped northward numbered three . in the front seat , alone at the driver 's wheel , a young man bent low . he was garbed in the uniform of a british lieutenant of cavalry . close inspection would have revealed the fact that the young man was a youth of some eighteen years , fair and good to look upon .\": 1,\n",

'' said garry , almost in one breath . `` ripping , '' shouted phil , while dick did n't wait to make any remark , but dived in through the door , and in a trice was putting in his call . phil followed suit , while garry waited , as he would talk when dick had finished . this pleasant duty done , they went to a restaurant for dinner . here they attracted no little attention , for their khaki clothes looked almost like uniforms . added to this was the fact that they wore forest shoepacks , those high laced moccasins with an extra leather sole , and felt campaign hats .\": 1,\n",
       "         'one day he had gone beyond any point which he had ever before visited . he traveled through an open wood , which enabled him to see a great distance . at length he beheld a light breaking through the foliage of the distant trees , which made him sure that he was on the borders of a prairie . it was a wide plain , covered with long blue grass , and enameled with flowers of a thousand lovely tints . after walking for some time without a path , musing upon the open country , and enjoying the fragrant breeze , he suddenly came to a ring worn among the grass and the flowers , as if it had been made by footsteps moving lightly round and round . but it was strange—so strange as to cause the white hawk to pause and gaze long and fixedly upon the ground—there was no path which led to this flowery circle . there was not even a crushed leaf nor a broken twig , nor the least trace of a footstep , approaching or retiring , to be found . he thought he would hide himself and lie in wait to discover , if he could , what this strange circle meant .': 1,\n",
       "         \"it was believed by the principal men of virginia that talbot 's sympathies were with the revolted colonies ; but the influence of his mother , to whom he had been accustomed to defer , had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself . his visit to england , and the delightful reception he had met with there , had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country , and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful . lord dunmore and colonel wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support , on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities . it was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the talbots would be revived by the king ; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country , with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every englishman , was eloquently portrayed by the other . when to the last plea was added the personal preference of katharine wilton , the balance was overcome , and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment .\": 1,\n",

       "         \"the human brain is arguably the most complex structure known to science . a century ago , the german korbinian brodmann made the first serious attempt at cataloging this complexity . he divided the cerebral cortex , the biggest and uniquely mammalian part of the brain , into about 50 regions based on their anatomical appearance . these are now known as `` brodmann areas . '' in modern neuroscience , we understand that some of these anatomical regions have similar functions , while others play multiple roles . for example , brodmann areas 39 , 40 , and part of 22 together make up `` wernicke 's area , '' named after carl wernicke , another german . wernicke 's area is crucial for our seemingly effortless ability to make sense of words ( as well as other forms of communication , such as sign language ) . when scientists first studied brains , they noticed that some parts were a bit darker in appearance than others , and called these `` gray matter '' and `` white matter . '' we now know that gray matter is made up of billions of nerve cells or neurons . white matter consists of the neural cables or axons that connect different brain regions .\": 1,\n",

'' the glow of the firefly is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferin . proteins are special food used by our bodies to create muscles , bones and skin while pigments are natural coloring substances found in plants and animals . when these two meet inside the tiny belly of the firefly , they react with the oxygen already found in there . a celebration takes place , a soft firework display , so to say and bright light is produced which is the ‘ glow ' of the firefly ! fireflies therefore are bioluminescent but they are not the only ones . different types of fish and marine creatures in the sea also produce their own lights !\": 1,\n",
