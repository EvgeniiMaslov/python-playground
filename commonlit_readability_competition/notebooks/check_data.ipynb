       "Counter({'when the young people returned to the ballroom , it presented a decidedly changed appearance . instead of an interior scene , it was a winter landscape . the floor was covered with snow-white canvas , not laid on smoothly , but rumpled over bumps and hillocks , like a real snow field . the numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room , were powdered with flour and strewn with tufts of cotton , like snow . also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them , and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches . at each end of the room , on the wall , hung a beautiful bear-skin rug . these rugs were for prizes , one for the girls and one for the boys . and this was the game . the girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other , and one end was called the north pole , and the other the south pole . each player was given a small flag which they were to plant on reaching the pole . this would have been an easy matter , but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes .': 1,\n",

'' `` oh , mother ! '' dolly cried , overwhelmed with sudden delight . `` really ? oh , i am so glad ! are you sure you 're willing ? '' `` i 've persuaded myself to be willing , against my will , '' returned mrs. fayre , whimsically . `` i confess i just hate to have you go , but i ca n't bear to deprive you of the pleasure trip . and , as you say , it would also keep dotty at home , and so , altogether , i think i shall have to give in . '' `` oh , you angel mother ! you blessed lady ! how good you are ! '' and dolly flew around the table and gave her mother a hug that nearly suffocated her .\": 1,\n",

'' `` well , i like that ! '' cried patty ; `` suppose you bear half the blame , roger . you see , mr. blaney , he is so absorbed in his own love game , he ca n't play with his old-time skill .

       "         \"hal and chester found ample time to take an inventory of the general 's car . it was a huge machine , and besides being fitted up luxuriously was also furnished as an office , that the general might still be at work while he hurried from one part of the field to another when events demanded his immediate presence . even now , with treachery threatening , and whirling along at a terrific speed , general joffre , probably because of habit , fell to work sorting papers , studying maps and other drawings . for almost two hours the car whirled along at top speed , and at length pulled up in the rear of an immense body of troops , who , even to hal and chester , could be seen preparing for an advance . general joffre was out of the car before it came to a full stop , and hal and chester were at his heels . an orderly approached . `` my respects to general tromp , and tell him i desire his presence immediately , '' ordered general joffre .\": 1,\n",

       "         \"on the twenty-second of february , 1916 , an automobile sped northward along the french battle line that for almost two years had held back the armies of the german emperor , strive as they would to win their way farther into the heart of france . for months the opposing forces had battled to a draw from the north sea to the boundary of switzerland , until now , as the day wanedâ€”it was almost six o'clockâ€”the hands of time drew closer and closer to the hour that was to mark the opening of the most bitter and destructive battle of the war , up to this time . it was the eve of the battle of verdun . the occupants of the automobile as it sped northward numbered three . in the front seat , alone at the driver 's wheel , a young man bent low . he was garbed in the uniform of a british lieutenant of cavalry . close inspection would have revealed the fact that the young man was a youth of some eighteen years , fair and good to look upon .\": 1,\n",

'' said garry , almost in one breath . `` ripping , '' shouted phil , while dick did n't wait to make any remark , but dived in through the door , and in a trice was putting in his call . phil followed suit , while garry waited , as he would talk when dick had finished . this pleasant duty done , they went to a restaurant for dinner . here they attracted no little attention , for their khaki clothes looked almost like uniforms . added to this was the fact that they wore forest shoepacks , those high laced moccasins with an extra leather sole , and felt campaign hats .\": 1,\n",
       "         'one day he had gone beyond any point which he had ever before visited . he traveled through an open wood , which enabled him to see a great distance . at length he beheld a light breaking through the foliage of the distant trees , which made him sure that he was on the borders of a prairie . it was a wide plain , covered with long blue grass , and enameled with flowers of a thousand lovely tints . after walking for some time without a path , musing upon the open country , and enjoying the fragrant breeze , he suddenly came to a ring worn among the grass and the flowers , as if it had been made by footsteps moving lightly round and round . but it was strangeâ€”so strange as to cause the white hawk to pause and gaze long and fixedly upon the groundâ€”there was no path which led to this flowery circle . there was not even a crushed leaf nor a broken twig , nor the least trace of a footstep , approaching or retiring , to be found . he thought he would hide himself and lie in wait to discover , if he could , what this strange circle meant .': 1,\n",
       "         \"it was believed by the principal men of virginia that talbot 's sympathies were with the revolted colonies ; but the influence of his mother , to whom he had been accustomed to defer , had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself . his visit to england , and the delightful reception he had met with there , had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country , and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful . lord dunmore and colonel wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support , on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities . it was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the talbots would be revived by the king ; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country , with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every englishman , was eloquently portrayed by the other . when to the last plea was added the personal preference of katharine wilton , the balance was overcome , and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment .\": 1,\n",

       "         \"the human brain is arguably the most complex structure known to science . a century ago , the german korbinian brodmann made the first serious attempt at cataloging this complexity . he divided the cerebral cortex , the biggest and uniquely mammalian part of the brain , into about 50 regions based on their anatomical appearance . these are now known as `` brodmann areas . '' in modern neuroscience , we understand that some of these anatomical regions have similar functions , while others play multiple roles . for example , brodmann areas 39 , 40 , and part of 22 together make up `` wernicke 's area , '' named after carl wernicke , another german . wernicke 's area is crucial for our seemingly effortless ability to make sense of words ( as well as other forms of communication , such as sign language ) . when scientists first studied brains , they noticed that some parts were a bit darker in appearance than others , and called these `` gray matter '' and `` white matter . '' we now know that gray matter is made up of billions of nerve cells or neurons . white matter consists of the neural cables or axons that connect different brain regions .\": 1,\n",

'' the glow of the firefly is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferin . proteins are special food used by our bodies to create muscles , bones and skin while pigments are natural coloring substances found in plants and animals . when these two meet inside the tiny belly of the firefly , they react with the oxygen already found in there . a celebration takes place , a soft firework display , so to say and bright light is produced which is the â€˜ glow ' of the firefly ! fireflies therefore are bioluminescent but they are not the only ones . different types of fish and marine creatures in the sea also produce their own lights !\": 1,\n",
