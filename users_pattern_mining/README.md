## User behavior data mining



This is capstone project for course ML and data analysis by MIPT and Yandex.



**Task description: ** Identifying a user by his behavior on the Internet is a complex and interesting task at the intersection of data analysis and behavioral psychology. This problem is being solved by both IT giants and startups and research teams. As an example, Yandex solves the problem of identifying a mailbox hacker by his behavior. The cracker will behave differently from the owner of the mailbox: he may not delete messages immediately after reading them, he will check the messages in a different way, and even move the mouse in his own way. Then such an intruder can be identified and "thrown out" from the mailbox by inviting the owner to enter using an SMS code. In this project, we will solve a similar problem: by a sequence of several websites visited in a row by the same person, we will identify this person. As the project progresses, we will see that linear models should not be underestimated, we will work with Vowpal Wabbit, and we will also gain valuable experience working with samples whose size does not allow us to create whatever we want.
